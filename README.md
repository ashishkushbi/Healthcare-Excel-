Before creating the dashboard, data cleaning and formatting were crucial for 100% accuracy. Almost every dashboard requires normalization, simplification, and aggregation for a clearer data picture. Power Query played a major role in making the process efficient and smooth.

✨ 𝑺𝒕𝒆𝒑𝒔 𝑻𝒂𝒌𝒆𝒏 𝒇𝒐𝒓 𝑫𝒂𝒕𝒂 𝑪𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈:
1️⃣ Power Query – Converted the name column into proper text format (Each Word Capitalized).
2️⃣ Data Types – Assigned correct data types to prevent errors in future analysis.
3️⃣ SWITCH Function – Grouped age ranges for better visualization of patient demographics.
4️⃣ DATEDIFF / WORKDAYS Function – Calculated the number of days patients were admitted.
5️⃣ Extracted Year – Retrieved the year from the date column for better filtering.
6️⃣ IF Function – Classified billing status as Paid, Due, or Unpaid.

🔹 Patient demographics – Breakdown by age group, admission type, medical prescription, and medical condition.
🔹 Insurance Analysis – Amount paid by insurance companies & percentage of insured patients.
🔹 Top 10 Hospitals – Ranked by revenue and patient count.
🔹 Key KPIs:

After preparing the data, I created a self-explanatory dashboard that speaks for itself to clients, stakeholders, and end-users.

✅ Carefully inserted charts 🎯 – ensuring clarity without misleading insights.
✅ Used blue medical theme 💙 – to align with the healthcare domain.
✅ Added icons 🎨 – to enhance visual appeal & highlight key stats.

This 2-day journey from data cleaning to dashboard creation brought me here on Monday! 🚀
